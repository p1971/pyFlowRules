    client: str
    
@policy(policy_id="P01", policy_name="InitialRequestValidation")
class InitialRequestPolicy(Policy):
    @rule(rule_id="R001", rule_name="Validate notional", failure_message="The notional is too high.")
    def validate_notional(self, r: Request):
        return r.notional < 100000
    
    @rule(rule_id="R002", rule_name="Validate client", failure_message="The client is unknown.")
    def validate_client(self, r: Request):
        return r.client in ["client1", "client2"]
  

policy = InitialRequestPolicy()
result = policy.execute(Request(id=1, notional=90000, client="client1"))
